    "## Defining the Data Analysis Workflow\n",
    "To effectively analyze Brent oil prices, I will follow a structured workflow that ensures the data is properly prepared, key patterns are identified, and meaningful insights are extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Understanding the Dataset\n",
    "* Identify how the Brent oil price data is generated, sampled, and compiled.\n",
    "* Check for missing values, data quality issues, and outliers.\n",
    "* Confirm the time range and frequency of the data (daily, weekly, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert dates to a consistent datetime format.\n",
    "* Handle any missing values or outliers that might distort the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualize historical trends in oil prices to identify key patterns.\n",
    "* Examine volatility using rolling averages and standard deviations.\n",
    "* Use change point detection techniques to identify major shifts in oil price behavior.\n",
    "## 4️ Statistical & Econometric Modeling\n",
    "* Implement ARIMA for time series forecasting.\n",
    "* Use GARCH to model oil price volatility.\n",
    "* Apply Vector Autoregression (VAR) to analyze oil prices alongside economic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation, exchange rates).\n",
    "* Explore Markov-Switching ARIMA to detect different market conditions.\n",
    "## 5️ Model Evaluation & Validation\n",
    "* Assess model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.\n",
    "* Compare different models to determine the best-performing approach.\n",
    "## 7️ Insights & Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "* The results will be communicated through reports, visualizations, and an interactive dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In Summary, \n",
    "- I will follow a structured data analysis workflow for understanding and modeling Brent oil prices.\n",
    "- The analysis will focus on change point detection, volatility modeling, and macroeconomic correlations.\n",
    "- Models such as ARIMA, GARCH, VAR, and Markov-Switching ARIMA will be used for forecasting and trend analysis.\n",
    "- The findings will be communicated visually using reports, dashboards, and presentations for stakeholders."
